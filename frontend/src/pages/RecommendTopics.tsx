          <p className="mb-4">
            Learning something new can feel overwhelming, especially when you donâ€™t know where to start.
            This guide will help you identify key areas to focus on depending on your interests and goals.
            Think of it as a roadmap: if you want to achieve X, focus on Y. Each section below provides
            guidance, actionable steps, and resources to explore further.

          <section className="mb-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">1. Web Development</h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              If you want to build websites or web applications, web development is a crucial skill.
              Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get the fundamentals. Then, move to frameworks like
              React, Angular, or Vue.js for building interactive UIs.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Learning backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, or Django will allow you to create full-stack applications.
              Understanding databases, both SQL and NoSQL, is also highly recommended. This knowledge will help you build
              real-world projects and prepare you for job interviews.

          <section className="mb-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              If your goal is to work with data, start with Python and its powerful libraries like Pandas, NumPy,
              and Matplotlib. R is also a great choice for statistical analysis and visualization.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Once comfortable with programming, learn machine learning algorithms such as linear regression,
              decision trees, and clustering. Tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch can help implement
              these algorithms practically. Building projects like predictive models, dashboards, and data visualizations
              will solidify your understanding.

          <section className="mb-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              If you are interested in protecting systems and networks, cybersecurity is a key field. Start with
              understanding networking basics, operating systems, and security fundamentals such as encryption and authentication.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Practical exercises like penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and setting up secure servers will
              reinforce your knowledge. Tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, and Metasploit are widely used in this domain.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4. DevOps and Cloud Computing</h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              DevOps focuses on bridging the gap between development and operations. Learning CI/CD pipelines, Docker,
              Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud can significantly improve your workflow and
              employability.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Automating deployment, monitoring applications, and scaling services are crucial skills that DevOps engineers
              need. Start with small projects like containerizing a web app and deploying it to the cloud.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">5. Soft Skills and Continuous Learning</h2>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Technical skills are important, but communication, problem-solving, and teamwork are equally vital.
              Work on personal projects, contribute to open-source, and participate in hackathons to improve both
              technical and soft skills.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Continuous learning is key: technology evolves rapidly. Subscribe to newsletters, follow industry blogs,
              and take online courses to stay updated with the latest trends.
